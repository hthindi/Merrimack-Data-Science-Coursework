####   2. The selected dataset has to have a minimum of 40 usable fields, where a usable field is defined as a numeric or string (i.e., alphanumeric values, such as ‘SKU_12345’ or ‘Female’) value that is a variable (as opposed to being constant across all records), contains less than 50% missing values, and is not a unique case ID;
####   3. You could earn bonus points if your project requires merging/linking multiple data sets;
####   4. Make sure to describe your data set, including a small representative sample in your Analytic Plan submission.
