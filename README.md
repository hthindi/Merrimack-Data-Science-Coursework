#### Predicting Precipitation Next Day in NW USA
##### Students are encouraged to use a provided data set, which can be found on Blackboard. If you wish to use another data set, please pay attention to the requirements below:
######   1. The selected dataset has to have a minimum of 10,000 records, where each data record representsa different case (e.g., a customer);
######   2. The selected dataset has to have a minimum of 40 usable fields, where a usable field is defined as a numeric or string (i.e., alphanumeric values, such as ‘SKU_12345’ or ‘Female’) value that is a variable (as opposed to being constant across all records), contains less than 50% missing values, and is not a unique case ID;
######   3. You could earn bonus points if your project requires merging/linking multiple data sets;
######   4. Make sure to describe your data set, including a small representative sample in your Analytic Plan submission.

###### It is important to note that the assessment in this course is built around hands-on, project-based work. Consequently, the individual Assignments can be seen as somewhat distinct elements, or parts of the larger project, the goal of which is to go through a full lifecycle of a relatively simple, yet very realistic applied machine learning project. With that in mind, the said full machine learning project lifecycle is divided into three general components of 1. Analytic Plan, 2. Preliminary Results, and 3. Final Report, which mirrors the commonly used analytic consulting process; each of those three core elements is briefly outlined below:
